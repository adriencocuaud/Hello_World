# Hello_World
présentation
Hi, my name is adrien, I'm a french teacher loving programmation and I'm especially interrested in the blockchain and more specifically etherium. 
Of course as a teacher I' would be glad to give a push in any education projest more over if it's about sciences. Oh and I'm writting all my production on LaTeX ;p 

A last word … vim power !
